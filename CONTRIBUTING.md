## How Can I Contribute?

### Reporting Bugs
Before creating bug reports, please check if the problem has already been reported. 

#### How Do I Submit A (Good) Bug Report?
Bugs are tracked as [GitHub issues](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/). 
Provide information by filling [the template](ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md).

Explain the problem and include additional details to help maintainers reproduce the problem:
* **Use a clear and descriptive title** for the issue to identify the problem.
* **Describe the exact steps which reproduce the problem** in as many details as possible. When listing steps, don't just say what you did, but explain how you did it.
* **Provide specific examples to demonstrate the steps**. Include links to files or GitHub projects, which you use in those examples.
* **Explain which behavior you expected and describe the behavior you observed** after following the steps and point out what exactly is the problem with that behavior.
* **Include screenshots and animated GIFs** which show you following the described steps and clearly demonstrate the problem. You can use [this tool](https://www.cockos.com/licecap/) to record GIFs on macOS and Windows, and [this tool](https://github.com/colinkeenan/silentcast) or [this tool](https://github.com/GNOME/byzanz) on Linux.
* **If you're reporting that the plugin crashed**, include a crash report with a stack trace from the operating system.

Provide more context by answering these questions:
* **Did the problem start happening recently** (e.g. after updating to a new version of the plugin or SonarQube) or was this always a problem?
* If the problem started happening recently, **can you reproduce the problem in an older version?** What's the most recent version in which the problem doesn't happen? You can download older versions from [the releases page](https://github.com/cnescatlab/i-CodeCNES/releases).
* **Can you reliably reproduce the issue?** If not, provide details about how often the problem happens and under which conditions it normally happens.

Include details about your configuration and environment:
* **Which SonarQube version are you using?** You can get the exact version at the bottom of your SonarQube instance.

### Suggesting Enhancements

* **Provide specific examples to demonstrate the steps**. Include copy/pasteable snippets which you use in those examples, as [Markdown code blocks](https://help.github.com/articles/markdown-basics/#multiple-lines).
* **Describe the current behavior** and **explain which behavior you expected to see instead** and why.
* **Include screenshots and animated GIFs** which help you demonstrate the steps or point out the part of Atom which the suggestion is related to.
