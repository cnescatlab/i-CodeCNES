This directory contains an interoperability example for BYacc/J and JFlex
(a small calculator)

You need the parser generator byacc/j from
http://troi.lincom-asg.com/~rjamison/byacc/
for this example to work (version byacc/j 1.1 has been tested).

Use the Makefile to generate the lexer and parser.
The example can then be started with

java Parser


files:

calc.flex
  JFlex specification for the lexical part of the arithmetic expressions

calc.y
  BYacc/J specification and main program for the calculator
