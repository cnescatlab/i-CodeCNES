This directory contains a scanner for a toy programming language.

It is the example from the JLex website with some small modifications,
to make it a bit more readable.

It does nothing really useful, because there is no parser for the
toy programming language. It's just a demonstatration how a small simple
scanner looks like.

files:

YYtoken.java:
  the tokens returned by the scanner

Utility.java:
  small class collecting some utility functions

simple.flex:
  the example specification

test.txt:
  sample input

output.good:
  output matching the sample input from test.txt

Makefile: (for Unix only)
  make          to generate scanner and run test
  make clean    to remove generated files
